                            <li class="list">EliteEventz team is notified.</li>
                            <li class="list">The reviewer is notified through email & SMS using the available contact information & asked to either submit a signed contract or proof of payment to verify whether or not the reviewer was a client of that vendor.</li>
                            <li class="list">The review is temporarily disabled from vendor’s profile, automatically.</li>
                            <li class="list">EliteEventz team will contact the reviewer within 12-24 working hours and ask to submit the aforementioned proof. The verification case will be closed if the reviewer fails to submit the proof within 7 days after being contacted. 
                                <ul class="sublist">
                                    <li class="list">If EliteEventz receives appropriate and satisfactory proof - The review will be reinstated on the vendor profile within 1 week, after notification to the vendor & the reviewer.</li>
